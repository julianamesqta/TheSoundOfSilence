# TheSoundOfSilence

The Sound Of Silence is a mobile game developed for the second Apple Developer Academy challenge. Our task was to create a horror experience using alternatives to sound, as music is typically a primary tool for building tension and atmosphere. Instead, this game leverages haptic feedback and striking visual elements to evoke a truly terrifying atmosphere.

Challenge Restrictions:

- The app must be developed using SwiftUI;
- 1 week for research;
- 1 week for design;
- 6 days for coding.
